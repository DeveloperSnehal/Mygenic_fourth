                            <p class="heading-desc">When a company hires a contract manufacturer, they agree on an arrangement where the manufacturer creates a product according to the company's specifications. The hiring company provides the necessary materials, packaging, and labeling instructions, while the contract manufacturer has the facilities, equipment, and workers for production.</p><br>
                            <p class="heading-desc">Using a contract manufacturer can be advantageous for companies because it helps them save money by avoiding the need to purchase expensive equipment or facilities. It also allows them to focus on other important aspects of their business, such as marketing and distribution.</p>
