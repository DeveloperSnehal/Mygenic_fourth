                            <p class="heading-desc">In the pharmaceutical industry, raw materials are essential for making medicines and drugs. These materials are called active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs), and they are responsible for the therapeutic effects of the drugs.</p><br>
                            <p class="heading-desc">APIs are the main substances used in producing medicines. They are active chemicals that directly affect the treatment of specific diseases or conditions. In addition to APIs, there are other substances called excipients. Excipients are non-active materials used in the formulation of drugs.</p><br>
                            <p class="heading-desc">During the manufacturing process, solvents are used to dissolve APIs and excipients. This helps mix them together and create the final form of the medication. Besides APIs and excipients, the pharmaceutical industry may also use other raw materials. These can include antimicrobial agents, antioxidants, chelating agents, and pH modifiers. These materials help maintain the stability of the drug, prevent microbial growth, and preserve its quality throughout its shelf life.</p><br>

                            <p class="heading-desc">Tablet: Tablets are solid medicines that contain active ingredients (APIs) and other substances called excipients. To make tablets, the ingredients are mixed together, turned into small particles, compressed into tablet form, coated if necessary, and then packaged.</p><br>
                            <p class="heading-desc">Syrup: Syrups are liquid medicines where APIs are dissolved or suspended in a solution. To make syrups, a solution or suspension is prepared, the ingredients are mixed and made even, the mixture is filtered, and then flavors and sweeteners are added. Finally, the syrup is packaged and ready for use.</p><br>
                            <p class="heading-desc">Injection: Injections are sterile formulations designed for injection into the body. Making injections requires strict cleanliness. The process can vary depending on the type of injection, such as intravenous, intramuscular, or subcutaneous. The general steps include sterilization, preparing the API solution, filtration, filling the containers, sealing them, conducting quality control checks, and packaging the injections for distribution and use.</p>

                            <p class="heading-desc">Ambient Storage: Many medications can be stored at room temperature, which is typically around 20-25°C (68-77°F). It's important to protect them from extreme heat, direct sunlight, moisture, and sudden temperature changes.</p><br>
                            <p class="heading-desc">Cold Chain Storage: Some medicines require specific temperature control and need to be stored in cold conditions. This is known as the "cold chain" and is crucial for vaccines and biologics. The cold chain ensures that these products are stored and transported at precise temperatures, from manufacturing to administration. It involves the use of refrigerators, freezers, temperature-monitoring devices, and appropriate transportation equipment.</p><br>
