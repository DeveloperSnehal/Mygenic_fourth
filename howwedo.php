                            <p class="heading-desc">Raw materials play a crucial role in the pharmaceutical industry as they are the building blocks for the production of drugs and medications. These materials, also known as active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs), are the substances responsible for the therapeutic effects of the drugs.</p><br>
                            <p class="heading-desc">APIs are the primary raw materials in drug formulation. They are chemically active substances that have a direct impact on the treatment of a specific disease or condition. Excipients are non-active substances used in drug formulation alongside APIs. Solvents are used during the manufacturing process to dissolve APIs and excipients, facilitating their combination and formulation into a final dosage form.</p><br>
                            <p class="heading-desc">In addition to the above, the pharmaceutical industry may use other raw materials such as antimicrobial agents, antioxidants, chelating agents, and pH modifiers. These materials assist in preserving the stability of the drug product, preventing microbial growth, and maintaining its quality over its shelf life.</p><br>

                            <p class="heading-desc">Tablet: Tablets are solid dosage forms that contain one or more active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs) along with excipients. The manufacturing process typically involves Blending, Granulation, Compression, Coating, Packaging process.</p><br>
                            <p class="heading-desc">Syrup: Syrups are liquid dosage forms containing dissolved or suspended APIs and flavoring agents. The manufacturing process typically involves Preparation of Solution/Suspension, Mixing and Homogenization, Filtration, Flavoring and Sweetening, Packaging process.</p><br>
                            <p class="heading-desc">Injection: Injections are sterile formulations intended for parenteral administration. The manufacturing process for injections involves strict aseptic techniques and may vary depending on the type of injection (e.g., intravenous, intramuscular, subcutaneous). Some general steps involved in injection manufacturing are Sterilization, Preparation of API Solution, Filtration and Clarification, Filling and Sealing, Quality Control, Packaging.</p>

This is the most common storage condition for many medications that do not require specific temperature controls. However, it's important to protect them from excessive heat, direct sunlight, moisture, and extreme temperature fluctuations.</p><br>
                            <p class="heading-desc">Cold Chain Storage: The cold chain refers to the uninterrupted temperature-controlled storage and transportation of temperature-sensitive pharmaceuticals, especially vaccines and biologics. It involves maintaining specific temperature ranges from the point of manufacture to the point of administration, including storage, transportation, and distribution. Cold chain storage typically requires a combination of refrigeration and freezer storage facilities, as well as temperature-monitoring devices and transportation equipment.</p><br>
